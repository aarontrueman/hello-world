# hello-world
I am a long-term thinker, disruptive technologies investor and a firm follower for best practice. The reason I am involved in Github is because when I studied more about Blockchain, the more I am passoionate about this revolutionary technology. I firmly believe this technology will fundamentally change how the worrld works. One important aspect of blockchain is the digital assets, and I think Github can help me to validate and understand the digital currencies.
