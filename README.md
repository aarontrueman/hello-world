# hello-world
I am a firm belilever in Web 3, a strategic thinke and disruptive technologies investor. The reason I am involved in Github is because when I studied more about Blockchain, the more I am fascinated about this revolutionary technology. I firmly believe this technology will fundamentally change how the world works. One important aspect of blockchain is digital assets, and I think Github can help me validate and understand the digital currencies.
